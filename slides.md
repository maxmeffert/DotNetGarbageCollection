> _In .NET, you need to think of memory performance at least as much as CPU performance. It is so fundamental to smooth .NET operation, that the most significant chunk of this bookâ€™s content is dedicated to just this topic._ - Ben Watson, Writing High-Perforamnce .NET Code

### Heaps

Heap = Process memory reserved for allocation of data.

A mangaged process has 2 kinds of heaps:

* __Native Heap__: used by Windows & CLR for unmanaged memory: Windows API, OS data structures, the CLR itself
* __Managed Heap__  (_GC Heap_): used by the CLR to allocation Objects subjected to garbage collection

---

### The Managed Heap

The Managed Heap is devided in 2 sections.

* __Small Object Heap (SOH)__ for objects < 85000 bytes which are most of all objects
* __Large Object heap (LOH)__ for objects >= 85000 bytes mostly arrays and strings

Size of an empty object: 16 bytes (32bit), 32 bytes (64bit).
Actually its 12 bytes and 24 bytes but the memory manager can't handle that very well.

---

### The Small Object Heap

The Small Object Heap is divided in 3 generations.

* __Gen 0__ the 1st genertaion
* __Gen 1__ the 2nd generation (serves as cache for Gen 2)
* __Gen 2__ the 3rd and last generation

Once in Gen 2, objects stay here till they _die_.

Objects are _alive_ as long as they are referenced by a __GC root__, e.g. static variables, managed threads or pinned handles.

---

### Segments

Segments = Fixed sized parts of memory owned by SOH or LOH.

* LOH & Gen 2 can span multiple segements
* Gen 0 & Gen 1 always reside in the same segment

---

### Allocation

The CLR tries to allocate new objects 3 times:

#### Fast Allocation
1. Try to allocate at the end of Gen 0

#### Slow Allocation
2. Try to allocate anywhere within Gen 0
3. Try to expand Gen 0 and allocate at the new end

__If expansion exceeds segement size a *Garbage Collection* is triggered!__

---

### Garbage Collection

Garbage Collection consists of 4 phases:

1. __Suspension__: Suspend all managed threads
2. __Mark__: Mark all objects reachable from any GC root as _seen_ (alive)
3. __Compact__: Relocate and promote seen objects to reduce memory fragmentation
4. __Resume__: Resume all suspended threads

Garbage Collection happens only for the triggering generation and lower generations.
Gen 2 colleciton also collects Gen 1 and Gen 0. Gen 1 collection also collects Gen 0.

All non-_seen_ objects die of here!

### The Most Important Rule

> _[...] the garbage collector was explicitly designed with this idea in mind: **Collect objects in Gen 0 or not at all.**_  - Ben Watson, Writing High-Perforamnce .NET Code

* Garbage collection for Gen 1 and Gen 2 are expensive

# Time spend on garbage collection is time not spend on the rest of your program!
